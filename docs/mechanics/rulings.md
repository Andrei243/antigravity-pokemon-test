# Rulings

Choices made where the games disagree with each other, or where a rule leans on something this game doesn't have. Plan 06 · R1 confirms the general ones (whose rules are the baseline, when the later mechanics appear); until then this file holds the rulings taken along the way. Each says what was chosen and why, so it can be changed in one place.

## Evolution (2026-10-02)

The baseline is Platinum's own code (`Pokemon_GetEvolutionTargetSpecies`, `Evolution_ProcessEvolutionEffects`); methods that came later follow the game that introduced them. `docs/mechanics/evolution.md` lists every method.

**Platinum's rules, kept as they are**

- Friendship evolutions happen at 220 (Generation 8 lowered it to 160 on a different scale). Sylveon, which asks for friendship and a Fairy move, uses the same 220.
- Night is 20:00 to 03:59; everything else is day.
- Evolution is checked after the battle, for the Pokémon that gained a level in it, never during it. Nothing evolves after a battle the player lost.
- The Everstone stops level-up and trade evolutions, not items used on the Pokémon. Kadabra evolves even holding one.
- B stops a level-up evolution; an item's or a trade's can't be stopped.
- A level-100 Pokémon can't evolve by level-up, because it can't gain a level.
- Shedinja appears only with a free place in the party and a Poké Ball in the bag, which is used up.
- The first of a species' evolutions whose condition holds is the one that happens. So a friendly Eevee beside the Moss Rock becomes Leafeon, and (from later games) one that also knows a Fairy move becomes Sylveon before Espeon or Umbreon.

**Stand-ins for what this game lacks**

| Species | The original asks for | Here | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Inkay | Level 30 with the console upside down | Level 30 | No console to turn |
| Finizen | Level 38 while playing with another player | Level 38 | No shared field; can be tightened once plan 07 exists |
| Tandemaus | Level 25, gained inside a battle | Level 25 | Evolution is checked after battles anyway |
| Pawmo, Bramblin, Rellor | 1000 steps walking beside the player (Let's Go), then a level | 1000 steps at the head of the party, then a level | No Pokémon walk beside the player |
| Stantler, Primeape | A move used 20 times (in Legends: Arceus, in the agile style) | The move used 20 times in battle, then a level | No battle styles |
| Bisharp | Knock out three Bisharp that hold a Leader's Crest | Be on the field when three Bisharp are knocked out, then a level | No leader Bisharp with their followers; the battle doesn't record who struck the last blow |
| Gimmighoul | 999 Gimmighoul Coins, then a level | The same: 999 in the bag, used up | |
| Meltan | 400 Meltan Candies in Pokémon GO | 400 Meltan Candies in the bag at a level-up, used up | The only method there has ever been |
| Milcery | The player spins while it holds a Sweet | The same: four quarter turns the same way | Turning takes a step here, so a tight circle counts |
| Ursaring | Peat Block under a full moon | Peat Block at night | No phases of the moon |
| Cosmoem | Solgaleo or Lunala by game version | Solgaleo by day, Lunala at night | No versions |
| (affection) | Pokémon-Amie hearts | Friendship 220 | Generation 8 folded affection into friendship |
| Sliggoo | Rain in the field | The same; battles' rain doesn't count | Done: the field's weather where the player stands (plan 04 · G9) |

**Trading**

- Trade evolutions stay trade evolutions: the game will have trading, online (plan 07) and with characters in the game (decided 2026-10-02). This replaces the idea in plan 03, decision 4, of swapping them for another method.
- A Linking Cord used on a Pokémon counts as a trade, as in Legends: Arceus. It needs the held item where the trade does, and a Shelmet in the party for Karrablast (and the other way round). Whether the game hands Linking Cords out is still open; nothing does yet.

**Not taken from later games**

- Leafeon, Glaceon, Magnezone and Probopass evolve at their places (Moss Rock, Ice Rock, a magnetic field), not with the stones Generation 8 switched to.
- Feebas evolves on Beauty, not by trade with a Prism Scale.
- A Rare Candy does nothing for a level-100 Pokémon.

## Friendship (2026-10-02)

Platinum's table and thresholds (`Pokemon_UpdateFriendship`). The +1 for being in the place the Pokémon was met is left out until Pokémon record where they were met. A traded Pokémon starts again at its species' base friendship.

## Pokédex (2026-10-04, plan 03 · D10)

**Platinum's rules, kept as they are**

- The Sinnoh Pokédex is Platinum's own 210 species in its order (`res/pokemon/sinnoh_pokedex.json` in the decompilation). Its SEEN and CAUGHT counts count those species only.
- The National Pokédex is opened after the Hall of Fame, once every species of the Sinnoh Pokédex has been seen (`Pokedex.CanUnlockNational`). The professor's scene that hands it over is the story's (plan 02, post-game).
- The Sinnoh diploma asks for all 210 species seen. The National one asks for every species caught except the mythical ones, which the games only ever gave out at events (23 of the 1025, by PokeAPI's flag).
- The search looks only among the species seen; ordering by weight or height looks only among those caught, whose size the Pokédex knows.
- The area page shows where a species lives in the grass at each time of day (morning is the table's own slots; the day and the night put their two species in slots 2 and 3; evening counts as day and late night as night), on the water and with each rod. Swarms, the Poké Radar and the species a second game in the console calls up are left out, as Platinum leaves them out.

**Stand-ins for what this game lacks**

| What | The original | Here | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Who hands out a diploma | The game director in Jubilife City's Game Freak building | The Pokédex itself, the first time it is opened once complete; it can be seen again from the search panel | Jubilife City is still a hand-made map without that building; plan 01 · M5 can move the ceremony there |
| A place a script takes the player into | Shown on the town map where the place is | The Great Marsh is shown at Pastoria City, whose gate leads into it; Turnback Cave's inner rooms where the rest of the cave is | No warp leads there, so the import can't find their place by itself |
| The size page's trainer | The player's silhouette | The player's own field sprite as a silhouette, 1.4 m tall for both characters | Our own choice of height |
